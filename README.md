# Cyao Brainf*ck interpreter

Welcome to the bf interpreter. This project aims to make a alternative executor for the [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

The reason brainfuck is chosen is because it is a relatively simple language and thus I can gain experience in programming language development (Start small, go big afterwards).

# Building
```
$ c++ main.cpp -O3 -std=c++20 -o bf
```

# Usage
```
$ ./bf [input file]
```

# Plans
Make a c to bf compiler
Make a llvm frontend for bf
