# Cyao Brainfuck interpreter

Welcome to the bf interpreter. This project aims to make a alternative executor for the [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language.

Why brainfuck? This language is chosen is because it is a relatively simple language and thus I can gain experience in programming language development.

This project has 0 dependencies on external libraries
